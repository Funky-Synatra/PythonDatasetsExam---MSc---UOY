# Python Datasets Exam - Data Analysis Project (MSc)

This repository contains a Python project that I developed as part of an exam for my Masters program. It focuses on data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using various Python libraries.

## Description

This project demonstrates my ability to:

*   Load and manipulate data using `pandas`.
*   Use `numpy` for numerical operations.
*   Perform data analysis techniques.
*  Visualize data using `matplotlib`.
*   Use Jupyter Notebook for documenting all of the steps.

This project was completed as part of an exam and it showcases my capacity to:

*   Understand data analysis problems and how to tackle them.
*   Implement and document a data analysis workflow using python.
*   Manipulate and produce insights from datasets.
*   Use Python libraries to handle data.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Open Jupyter Notebook:** Open the `DatasetsExam.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
4.  **Run the Notebook:** Execute the code cells in the notebook to see the results.

## Important Notes

*   This project was developed as part of a Masters exam, and it's designed to be an exercise, rather than a fully fleshed out application.
*   The dataset files are stored in the `data` folder.
*   This code is being shared as is, for portfolio and illustrative purposes.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided as is and is intended for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## About Me

This project showcases my data analysis skills, which I've been honing during my Master's program in Computer Science and AI. I have also worked in other areas such as web development, mobile development, and game development.
